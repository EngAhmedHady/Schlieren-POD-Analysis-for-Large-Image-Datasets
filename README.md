# Schlieren-POD-Analysis-for-Large-Image-Datasets
This Python script performs a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) on very large sets of images, such as those from high-speed schlieren. It's specifically optimized to handle datasets that are too large to fit into memory, employing a two-pass streaming approach to manage memory efficiently.
